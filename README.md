A simple TO-DO list that I created in my Intro to Web Development class at Saint Martin's University. 

Features:
1. Add To-Do's to a list
2. Remove To-Do's from the list
3. Saves your To-Do's for when you return


How to run:
1. If you download it, you just need to ensure all three files are in the same folder, then run index.html in the browser.
2. Otherwise head to https://jbowen999.github.io/Web_Todo_List/
